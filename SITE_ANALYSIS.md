# Zero Harm Initiative - Site Analysis

## Current File Structure
- **Main page**: `animal-charity-website (3).html` (needs to be renamed to index.html)
- **Logo file**: `image (6).jpeg` (needs to be renamed to logo.jpeg)
- **Other pages**: 
  - action-page.html
  - contact-page.html
  - resources-page.html
  - journey-page.html
  - mission-page.html
  - impact-page.html

## Issues Found
1. **File naming**: Main page has non-standard name
2. **Branding**: All pages reference "VOICES" or "Voices for the Voiceless"
3. **Navigation links**: Currently use inconsistent paths (some use index.html, some use #anchors)
4. **Logo**: Currently text-based, needs image integration
5. **Missing assets folder**: No organized structure for images/assets

## Logo Integration Points
1. **Navigation bar** - Replace text logo with image
2. **Hero sections** - Add logo watermark or featured placement
3. **Footer** - Include logo with organization info
4. **Form sections** - Brand reinforcement
5. **Loading screen** (optional enhancement)

## Link Structure Issues
- Main page links use # anchors (likely for single-page sections)
- Other pages link to specific .html files
- Need consistent navigation across all pages
- Missing links to some pages (no donate.html exists)
