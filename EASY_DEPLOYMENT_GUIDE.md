## Part 2: Upload Your Website to GitHub (10 minutes)

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Easier)

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Once logged in, click the green "New" button (or go to https://github.com/new)
   - Name it: `zero-harm-initiative`
   - Keep it "Public" (so Render can see it)
   - Don't check any boxes
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload Your Files**
   - On the next page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag ALL your website files into the box:
     - All `.html` files
     - `logo.jpeg`
     - `README.md`
   - Write a message like "Adding website files"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option B: Using Git Commands (If Option A doesn't work)

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to your website folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/zhi/folder
   ```
3. Run these commands one by one:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zero-harm-initiative.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

## Part 3: Create a Render Account (3 minutes)

Render is the service that will host your website for free.

2. **Sign Up**
   - Click "Sign up with GitHub" (easiest way!)
   - It will ask to connect to your GitHub
   - Click "Authorize Render"

   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master` if that's what shows)

   - Click "Create Static Site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes while it deploys
   - You'll see "Your site is live!" when done

## Part 5: Visit Your Website! üéâ

Your website is now online at:
```
https://zero-harm-initiative.onrender.com
```
(Or whatever name you chose + .onrender.com)

Share this link with everyone!

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see my repository in Render"
- Make sure your GitHub repository is set to "Public" not "Private"
- Try logging out and back into Render

### "My images aren't showing"
- Check that `logo.jpeg` was uploaded to GitHub
- File names are case-sensitive (Logo.jpeg ‚â† logo.jpeg)

### "The site looks weird"
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Try a different browser

### "I messed up somewhere"
- Don't worry! You can always delete and start over
- Nothing you do will break anything permanently
